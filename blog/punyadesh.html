            <h1>Punyadesh: A Country of Merit</h1>
            <p>
            Punyadesh (Hindi: पुण्यदेश) - meaning "country of merit" - is a new country in southeastern Asia.
            With a long, tumultuous history of war, French colonial patrimony, and poverty, 
            Punyadesh has created a government that promotes merit and virtue rather than violence and strength.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Branches of Government</h1>
            <h2>Legislature</h2>
            <p>
            Like the National People's Congress of China, Punyadesh has a unicameral Congress.
            </p>
            <h2>Executive</h2>
            <p>
            Modeled after Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council, and presidential system,
            Punyadesh's executive branch consists of a President and a Council of Experts.
            Although the powerful exectutive system of Mexico was briefly considered, it was soon rejected.
            </p>

            <h3>The President</h3>

            <h4>Selection Process</h4>
            <p>
            Like in Iran, the President is democratically elected via popular vote from a pool of candidates selected by the Council of Experts.
            The Council must select candidates above the age of 18 that have shown academic merit and virtue.
            Also like in Iran, a majority (as opposed to a plurality) is needed to win a Presidential election.
            Therefore, in the case of no majority, another vote is held, eliminating all but the top two candidates.
            </p>

            <h4>Terms</h4>
            <p>
            Inspired by many presidential systems, including Iran's, the President of Punyadesh serves for a four-year term.
            The President may only run for two terms, and the must be consecutive. <br>
            <br>
            This differs from the system in Mexico, where Presidents may only serve a for a single, six-year term.
            </p>

            <h4>Powers</h4>
            <p>
            Like Iran's president, the President of Punyadesh holds little power in practice.
            The President is subject to the will of the Council of Experts. 
            The President acts as the head of state for international affairs and communication to the public.
            The President has the ability to sign or veto laws, as well as to request modifications.
            The President does not control governmental agencies.<br>
            <br>
            This is distinct from Mexico's presidential system, which has a very powerful president.
            </p>

            <h3>The Council of Experts</h3>
            <p>
            While Iran's Experts focus on religous expertise, Experts in Punyadesh can specialize in a wide variety of fields.
            </p>

            <h4>Selection Process</h4>
            <p>
            The Council of Experts is selected by Congress via Confucian-style examinations and performance tests.
            The content of the exams is drafted by the Council itself, while the exams are administered and scored by Congress.
            Candidates compete for a specific role in the Council, such as Expert of Economy or Expert of National Security.
            Anyone above the age of 18 may take the exams.
            In order to remove bias is scoring, the identities of candidates are kept anonymous until after the selection process has been completed.<br>
            <br>
            This is unlike Iran, where the Assembly of Experts is elected by popular vote and the Guardian Council is selected by the Supreme Leader and the Majles.
            </p>

            <h4>Terms</h4>
            <p>
            Experts serve for one-year terms.
            </p>
