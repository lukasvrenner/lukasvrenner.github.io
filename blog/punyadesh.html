            <h1>Punyadesh: A Country of Merit</h1>
            <p>
            Punyadesh (Hindi: पुण्यदेश) - meaning "country of merit" - is a new country in southeast Asia.
            Punyadesh is a meritocracy.
            With a long, tumultuous history of war, French colonial patrimony, and poverty, 
            Punyadesh has created a government that promotes merit and virtue rather than violence and strength.
            In order to survive, its government must be able to make the best choices.

                        <h2>Legislature</h2>
                        <h3>Legislature in Iran</h3>
                        <p>
                        The Islamic Consultative Assembly, also known as the Iranian Majles, is the unicameral parliament of Iran.
                        Iran's legislature is called a parliament but Iran does not have a parliamentary government.
                        The Majles has the power to create laws, approve treaties, investigate national affairs, and more, although many of its powers are checked by the Guardian Council.
                        For example, for the Majles to pass a law, the Guardian Council must approve it. 
                        Candidates must be between 30 and 75 years, must have a associates degree or equivalent, and must be approved by the Guardian Council. 
                        They are elected for a four-year term, and the 290 members represent Iran's 207 electoral districts.<br>

                        <h3>Legislature in China</h3>
                        <p>
                        The National People's Congress (NPC) is the unicameral congress of China. 
                        On paper, the NPC is the highest organ of the People's Republic of China and is the only branch of government.
                        However, it is largely subvervient to the Chinese Communist Party.
                        Representatives are elected for five-year terms. 
                        They are elected by provincial people's congresses, which are elected by local people's congresses, which are elected via popular vote.
                        The NPC has the power to amend the constitution, make laws, elect the President, and Vice President, create provinces, and make war and peace, as well as others.<br>

                        <h3>Legislature in Punyadesh</h3>
                        <p>
                        Punyadesh's Congress is heavily influenced by Iran's Islamic Consultative Assembly.
                        It is a unicameral legislature.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Chinese NPC is not well suited for Punyadesh because of its large nature. 
                        With a total of 2,977 members and its indirect election system, it is not a good fit for a small country like Punyadesh.
                        The Iranian legislature, on the other hand, is a great match. It prioritizes experience and knowledge in its candidates, and is fairly small.
                        It has power, but isn't dominant.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Selection Process</h4>
                        <p>
                        Each regional district receives a number of representatives proportional to its population size.
                        As in Iran, Representatives of the Congress of Punyadesh are elected via popular vote with a qualified majority two-round system.
                        Additionally inspired by Iran, candidates must have an associates-equivalent university degree.
                        However, unlike in Iran, anyone that is qualified may run for office.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Terms</h4>
                        <p>
                        Like in Iran, representatives serve a four-year term.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Powers</h4>
                        <p>
                        The Congress of Punyadesh has similar powers to that of Iran. However, it has a few additional powers, and, without a Guardian Council, is less regulated. 
                        It administers and scores Confucian-style examinations to select members of the Council of Experts.

                        <h2>Executive</h2>

                        <h3>Executive in Iran</h3>
                        <p>
                        Iran has a dual executive, with both a Supreme Leader and a President. The Supreme Leader is the head of state and is the most powerful figure in the Iranian government.
                        The Supreme Leader is chosen by the Assembly of Experts, which is also democratically elected.
                        The Supreme Leader controls the military, can declare war, selects six members of the Guardian Council,
                        appoints the Chief Justice of Iran, can veto laws passed by parliament, and much more.
                        The Supreme Leader serves for life but can be removed by the Assembly of Experts.<br>
                        <br>
                        The President is democratically elected by popular vote but has limited power and is largely checked by the Supreme Leader. The President is the head of government.
                        In order for a presidential candidate to win an election, they must receive a majority vote (more than 50%).
                        If, after the first round of voting, no candidate has a majority, then there is a second round with the top two candidates.
                        Presidential candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council.
                        The President serves four-year terms and may be reelected for one additional consecutive term.
                        The President appoints a cabinet and can sign treaties (with consent from parliament). They are the deputy commander in chief of the military.<br>

                        <h3>Executive in Mexico</h3>
                        <p>
                        The President of the United Mexican States is the singular head of state and head of government.
                        The President is elected by plurality of popular vote. They serve a single six-year term. The President executes laws passed by Congress, conduct foreign policy, 
                        They are the commander in chief of the armed forces and have the ability to declare war (with approval from Congress).<br>

                        <h3>Executive in Punyadesh</h3>
                        <p>
                        Modeled after Iran's executive system and Guardian Council,
                        Punyadesh's executive branch consists of a President and a Council of Experts, with no Supreme Leader.<br>
                        <br>
                        Although both Mexico and Iran have a powerful executive, the Iranian executive was chosen because of its emphasis on expertise and a limited president.
                        Because of Punyadesh's struggles with poverty and foreign forces, the country needs an executive that knows how to make the best decisions, whether they're popular or not.
                        By having a large, dual executive, power is diversified. This is essential in a country plagued with violence.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The President of Punyadesh</h3>

                        <h4>Selection Process</h4>
                        <p>
                        Like in Iran, the President is democratically elected via popular vote from a pool of candidates selected by the Council of Experts.
                        The Council must select candidates above the age of 18 that have shown academic merit and virtue.
                        Also like in Iran, a majority (as opposed to a plurality) is needed to win a Presidential election.
                        Therefore, in the case of no majority, another vote is held, eliminating all but the top two candidates.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Terms</h4>
                        <p>
                        Like Iran's President, the President of Punyadesh serves for a four-year term.
                        The President may only run for two terms, and the must be consecutive.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Powers</h4>
                        <p>
                        Like Iran's president, the President of Punyadesh holds little power in practice.
                        The President is subject to the will of the Council of Experts. 
                        The President acts as the head of state for international affairs and communication to the public. This differs from the Iranian President.
                        The President has the ability to sign or veto laws, as well as to request modifications. This power belongs to the Iranian Supreme Leader rather than the President.
                        The President does not control governmental agencies.<br>
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Council of Experts of Punyadesh</h3>
                        <p>
                        While Iran's Assembly of Experts, Supreme Leader, and Guardian Council focus on religous expertise, Experts in Punyadesh can specialize in a wide variety of fields,
                        such as economics or national security.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Selection Process</h4>
                        <p>
                        The Council of Experts is selected by Congress via Confucian-style examinations and performance tests.
                        The content of the exams is drafted by the Council itself, while the exams are administered and scored by Congress.
                        Candidates compete for a specific role in the Council.
                        Anyone above the age of 18 may take the exams.
                        In order to remove bias is scoring, the identities of candidates are kept anonymous until after the selection process has been completed.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is unlike Iran, where the Assembly of Experts is elected by popular vote and the Guardian Council is selected by the Supreme Leader and the Majles.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Terms</h4>
                        <p>
                        In Iran, members of the Assembly of Experts serve eight-year terms. 
                        In Punyadesh, Experts serve one-year terms. They may serve as many terms as they wish, as long as they are reselected.
                        This is to make certain that each Expert maintains a high level of excellence.<br>
                        <br>
                        Each Expert must participate in biweekly Question Time. This is taken from the United Kingdom's Question Time.
                        During Question Time, members of Congress drill Experts with challenging questions regarding their decisions, how they will handle issues, and more.
                        If an Expert fails to answer successfully, they could be removed from the Council.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is to ensure that Experts make the best choices.

                        Although the judiciaries of both Mexico and Russia have judicial review, Russia's separated, lifelong system is the best fit for Punyadesh.
                        Because justices serve for life, they will gain lots of experience and knowledge. 
                        If the judiciary were elected, popularity and public image would be prioritized over expertise. 
                        Because Punyadesh values merit, the Russian judicial system is the way to go.

                        Although the central government has granted some power through devolution to local governments or its subcountries such as Scottland and Wales,
                        it has the ability to revoke the power at any time.<br>

                        <h3>A Unitary Punyadesh</h3>
                        <p>
                        Punyadesh chose a unitary system of government because of its small size and relative cultural homogeneity.
                        A unitary system is effective in resolving cleavages because it can make a final, authoritative decision, whereas a federal system can lead to conflict between states.

                        <h3>Civil Liberties in Russia</h3>
                        <p>
                        Russia is an illiberal democracy. The state has control of the media, severely censors the Internet, and punishes those who speak against the state.
                        The constitution claims many civil liberties such as freedom of speech, associations, and religion, but, in practice, many of these are weak or nonexistent.<br>

                        <h3>Civil Liberties in the United Kingdom</h3>
                        <p>
                        Citizens of the United Kingdom exercise many civil liberties, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the right to a fair trial, and many more.
                        With some exceptions, these have been effectively exercised and protected.<br>

                        <h3>Civil Liberties in Punyadesh</h3>
                        <p>
                        Civil liberties are important. Punyadesh has a bad history of corruption and abuse. 
                        As such, it is vital that citizens of the new government can exercise civil liberties. They are a basic human right and are vital to a meritocratic government.
