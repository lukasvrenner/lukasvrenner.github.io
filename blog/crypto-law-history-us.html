            <h2>A History of Modern Cryptography Law in the United States</h2>

            <h3>World War II: The Beginning of a New Cryptographic Era</h3>
            <p>
            During World War II, Nazi Germany desigend and extensively used
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma machines</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher">Lorenz ciphers</a>
            to conceal military communications. Polish mathmeticians
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Rejewski">Marian Rejewski</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki">Jerzy Różycki</a>,
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a> and British mathmeticians
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Welchman">Gordon Welchman</a>
            used advanced techniques to crack Enigma's encryption and decrypt German military communications. They devised a mechanical machine known as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">bombe</a> to greatly accelerate the process of decrypting German messages.
            Ever since, machines and algorithms that protect and deprotect messages have exploded in capabilities and power.<br>

            <h3>Regulations in the 20th Century</h3>
            <p>
            The U.S. has never restricted cryptographic use within the States.
            However, beginning in the early 1900s, the U.S. has been strict about export of cryptographic technology.
            From 1954 until <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-11-19/pdf/96-29692.pdf">1996</a>,
            encryption technology was included in the U.S. Munitions List.
            During the Cold War, The U.S. was careful that the Eastern bloc did not gain access to such technology.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917">Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917</a>,
            the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=63&page=7">Export Control Act of 1949</a>
            and others allowed the President to regulate nearly all exports.
            The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1079/pdf/COMPS-1079.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977</a>
            succeeded these, requiring the President to declare an emergency.
            However, since there are few limits to the President's ability to declare an emergency, this is a weak limitation and has often been abused.<br>
            <br>
            In the 1990s, with the advent of PCs, cryptographic regulations became challenged at the indivdual level.
            Technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> and
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>SSL</a>
            (predecessor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>) were firmly regulated.<br>
            <br>
            PGP's original author, Phil Zimmermann was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Criminal_investigation">placed under criminal investigation</a>
            when PGP made its way outside of the U.S.. Zimmermann fought back by publishing PGP's entire source code in a book.<br>
            <br>
            <abbr title="Secure Socket Layer">SSL</abbr> was divided into a U.S. edition and and a much weaker international edition.
            </p>

            <h3>The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and Export Administration Regulations</h3>
            <p>
            The <a href=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5040/text>Export Control Reform Act of 2018</a>
            authorizes the President to 
            <q>control the export, reexport, and transfer of commodities, software, and technology to protect the national security,
                and to promote the foreign policy, of the United States, and for other purposes.</q>
            This is the legal basis for the <abbr title="Bureau of Industry and Security">BIS</abbr>'s
            <a href="https://www.bis.gov/regulations">Export Administration Regulations</a> (EAR).<br>
            <br>
            The <abbr title="Export Administration Regulations">EAR</abbr> requires a license for the export of some cryptographic technology.
            The power to grant and deny these licenses lies in the <abbr title="Bureau of Industry and Security">BIS</abbr>.
            However, according to the <abbr title="Bureau of Industry and Security">BIS</abbr>, publicly available encryption source code is not subject to the
            <abbr title="Export Administration Regulations">EAR</abbr> once a notification email is sent to the 
            <abbr title="Bureau of Industry and Security">BIS</abbr> and <abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr>.
            In order to publish <a href="https://github.com/lukasvrenner/turtls">TurTLS</a> on the Internet, I was required to send a notification email.
